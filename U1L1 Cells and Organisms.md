# Unit 1: Cells and Organisms
## Lesson 1: Understanding Cells and Organisms

NGSS: MS-LS1-1
Objectives:
- Identify the basic unit of life as the cell.
- Differentiate between unicellular and multicellular organisms.
- Explain the relationship between cells and organisms.
- Investigate and provide evidence that living things are made of cells.
## Introduction
Hi there! Today, we're going to talk about all living things, which we call **organisms**. Did you know that everything living, from big elephants to tiny ants, is made from tiny building blocks called **cells**? Letâ€™s learn more!

## Section 1: What Are Cells?
Think of a busy town. Just like a town has many parts like houses, shops, and parks, living things have small parts called cells. Each cell is like a tiny factory. It eats food, drinks water, gets rid of waste, uses energy, and talks to its surroundings. Cells are very special because they are the smallest thing that can do all the jobs needed for life.

## Section 2: Unicellular vs Multicellular Organisms
Some living things are made of just one cell; we call them **unicellular organisms**. Examples are bacteria and amoebas. They live life all by themselves. But other living things are made of many cells; we call them **multicellular organisms**. Animals, plants, and humans are multicellular. In multicellular organisms, cells work together like a team, and each one has a special job.

## Section 3: The Origin of New Cells
Where do new cells come from? They come from other cells! There's a process called **cell division** where one cell grows bigger and then splits into two new cells. It's like one cell making a copy of itself.

## Section 4: Observing Cells
Cells are very small, so small that we can't see them with just our eyes. But we have a tool called a **microscope** that helps us see them. A microscope makes small things look bigger so we can explore the tiny world of cells.

## Section 5: Importance of Cells in Organisms
Cells are very important because they are the building blocks of all living things. They do many jobs to keep living things alive and healthy. Every living thing depends on its cells to live and grow.

## Summary
Today, we learned that cells are amazing little building blocks of all living things. They do many important jobs, and they work together to make life possible.

## Review Questions

2. What is the difference between unicellular and multicellular organisms?
3. How are new cells made?
4. How can we see cells?
5. Why are cells important in living things?
