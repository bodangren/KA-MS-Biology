# Unit 1: Cells and Organisms

## Lesson 4: Cells and organisms: Review and Quiz 1
- **NGSS**: MS-LS1-1, MS-LS1-2
- **Objectives**:
  1. Assess understanding of the basic structure and functions of a cell.
  2. Evaluate knowledge of the relationship between cells and organisms.

## Review Activities:

### Activity 1: Group Discussion
Divide the class into small groups. Each group will discuss and create a summary of key points from Lessons 1-3. They will share their summaries with the class. Encourage students to ask questions if they have any doubts or if they want to discuss a topic in more detail.

### Activity 2: Cell Model Building
In pairs, students will create 3D models of a cell using craft materials. They should label the organelles and write a brief description of their functions. Display the models in the classroom for everyone to see and learn.

### Activity 3: Cell Function Skits
Groups will create short skits to demonstrate the functions of different cell organelles. They can use props, costumes, and creative scripts to illustrate how organelles work together within a cell.

## Quiz:

### Section A: Multiple Choice (Knowledge)
1. What is the basic unit of life?
    a) Atom
    b) Molecule
    c) Cell
    d) Organism
2. Which organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell?
    a) Nucleus
    b) Chloroplast
    c) Mitochondria
    d) Endoplasmic Reticulum

### Section B: True or False (Understanding)
1. All living organisms are made up of at least one cell. (True/False)
2. Animal cells have chloroplasts for photosynthesis. (True/False)

### Section C: Short Answer (Application)
1. Describe how the cell membrane helps maintain a stable environment within the cell.
2. Explain how the nucleus and mitochondria interact to ensure the cell functions properly.

### Section D: Analysis
1. Given a diagram of an animal cell and a plant cell, identify the organelles and describe the function of each.
2. Analyze how the absence of a nucleus in a cell would affect its function.

## Cooperative Activities Post-Quiz:

### Activity 1: Peer Review
Students exchange their quizzes with a peer for review. Discuss the answers as a class, explaining the correct answers and clarifying any misconceptions.

### Activity 2: Reflection
Individually, students will write a reflection on what they have learned in this unit so far, what they found interesting, and any questions they still have. Share reflections if time allows.

### Activity 3: Quiz Correction
Students work in pairs to correct their quizzes, using textbooks, notes, and discussion to understand any mistakes and learn from them.

## Glossary:
- **Organelle**: A specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function.
- **Cell Membrane**: The semipermeable membrane surrounding the cytoplasm of a cell.
- **Mitochondria**: An organelle found in large numbers in most cells, in which the biochemical processes of respiration and energy production occur.
- **Nucleus**: A part of the cell containing DNA and RNA and responsible for growth and reproduction.
